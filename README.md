# Reverse reports

Here is some reverse reports I've made for professional reason. The reports published in this repository are anonymised and can be used for cybersecurity research or educational purposes.

The reports include an analysis of some malwares found, how deobfuscation have been made, what IoC have been found and samples of the analysed malware at different point on the deobfuscation process.

__Warning :__
Some files present here are malicious, be careful of what you do with them.
